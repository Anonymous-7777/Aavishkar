### **🎯 Project Summary**
**Goal:** Build a simplified MVP of an AI-based virtual interviewer with facial expression detection, voice analysis, and feedback on performance.

---

## 🗓️ 10-Day Preparation Plan

### **🧠 Roles Assignment (Day 1)**
Assign rough roles based on interest:
- **Person 1** – Facial Expression Detection (OpenCV/TensorFlow)
- **Person 2** – Voice Analysis (Librosa)
- **Person 3** – NLP + Feedback (spaCy / HuggingFace)
- **Person 4** – Frontend (React) + Basic Backend (Flask preferred for Python familiarity)

---

### **📅 Day-by-Day Plan**

#### **Day 1–2: Understand Tools + Setup**
- **All:** Set up Python, GitHub repo, and virtual environments.
- **Explore basics:**
  - OpenCV: Face detection tutorials
  - Librosa: Audio feature extraction (pitch, tempo)
  - Hugging Face/spaCy: Sentiment or intent detection
  - Flask + React: Hello World apps to test integration

#### **Day 3–4: Build Mini Prototypes**
- **Person 1:** Detect basic facial expressions using OpenCV (smile, frown)
- **Person 2:** Record audio & extract features (pitch, pauses) using Librosa
- **Person 3:** Analyze basic interview answers for positivity/negativity
- **Person 4:** Create frontend form to record video/audio + simple Flask API

#### **Day 5–6: Connect Components**
- Combine frontend (React) with Flask backend
- Route video/audio to backend → run facial/audio/NLP analysis
- Return basic feedback (e.g., "You looked nervous", "You paused a lot")

#### **Day 7: MVP Dry Run**
- Conduct a full mock interview session
- Evaluate what works, what crashes
- Identify pain points and missing pieces

#### **Day 8–9: Polish & Optimize**
- Add simple scoring system
- Display results cleanly on the frontend
- Make sure each component is robust enough for demo

#### **Day 10: Pitch & Presentation**
- Prepare a 2-3 minute live demo script
- Make a short slide deck: Problem → Solution → Tech → Demo → Impact
- Assign a presenter, practice your pitch

## 🔧 During the Hackathon (48 Hours)

### **Day 1 (First 24 hours)**
- Morning: Set up everything fresh, ensure no env issues
- Day: Integrate components & make MVP
- Night: Run internal testing

### **Day 2 (Second 24 hours)**
- Morning: Polish, fix bugs, add insights
- Day: Practice pitch and prepare demo video if required
- End: Submit + present confidently

## 💡 Tips
- Don’t try to do everything (e.g., real-time ML isn’t needed — fake a delay if needed).
- Use pre-trained models from Hugging Face or TensorFlow Hub.
- Focus on wow factor in demo: even if it's 50% functional, make it *look* smooth.
- Keep communication tight: use a shared task board (Trello/Notion).
